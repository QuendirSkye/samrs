# samrs
Steam Achievement Manager, in Rust

## Separated into the following crates:
### samrs
The backend, or the core.\
The functionality, in a crate of it's own.\
Different interfaces (CLI, TUI, GUI) can be built on top of this.

### samrs_cli
A very basic CLI interface.

### samrs_gui
Not a priority at the moment.
